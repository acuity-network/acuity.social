This includes content revisioning, comments, feeds, tags, mentions, trusted accounts, emoji reactions, tokens. There is no backend whatsoever.</p><p id="3cca" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Another decentralized social media project is LBRY. It is based on a clone of Bitcoin. This severely limits the complexity of what can be accomplished on-chain. Also LBRY uses the much older Bitorrent instead of IPFS. It is not practical to store a very large number of small individual content items on Bitorrent.</p><p id="e0ac" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Being based on a clone of Ethereum means MIX Acuity has a very rich and extensible feature set that can be implemented without a backend. This means it cannot be a target for control.</p><p id="d459" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Ethereum 1.x blockchains use proof of work (PoW — similar to Bitcoin). Steem and EOS use delegated proof of stake (DPos).

Currently when MIX Acuity creates an account, the controller is the externally owned account, but much more sophisticated arrangements are possible. One or more intermediate contracts can be deployed between the external and contract accounts.</p><p id="56f1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This can add a range of improved functionality:</p><ul class=""><li id="ca8c" class="nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi pg ph pi bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">change account private key</li><li id="5c15" class="nl nm fr nn b no pj nq nr ns pk nu nv nw pl ny nz oa pm oc od oe pn og oh oi pg ph pi bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">separate key on each device</li><li id="c6c0" class="nl nm fr nn b no pj nq nr ns pk nu nv nw pl ny nz oa pm oc od oe pn og oh oi pg ph pi bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">social recovery</li><li id="cf1d" class="nl nm fr nn b no pj nq nr ns pk nu nv nw pl ny nz oa pm oc od oe pn og oh oi pg ph pi bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">allow other addresses to perform certain actions from the account</li><li id="ab34" class="nl nm fr nn b no pj nq nr ns pk nu nv nw pl ny nz oa pm oc od oe pn og oh oi pg ph pi bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">require certain actions to require more time or multisig</li><li id="3436" class="nl nm fr nn b no pj nq nr ns pk nu nv nw pl ny nz oa pm oc od oe pn og oh oi pg ph pi bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">combining multiple transactions into one to reduce gas costs</li></ul><p id="a1a9" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph=""><strong class="nn fs">Logging</strong></p><p id="2ea1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">When the account receives a MIX or ERC1155 token deposit, this is logged from the smart contract.

With Protocol Buffers it is possible to add new fields to existing schemas without breaking backward compatibility for software that doesn’t know about the new fields. There is an on-chain mixin inheritance tree so old software can still find useful information in new mixins derived from old ones.</p><h2 id="f9d5" class="ok mo fr be mp ol om on mt oo op oq mx nw or os ot oa ou ov ow oe ox oy oz pa bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Emoji Reactions</h2><p id="6b32" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Accounts can respond to content items with emojis.

Each variant is then published to IPFS. An Acuity item is then created with all the IPFS hashes, title, description, etc using Google Protocol Buffers. The item is compressed using Google Brotli and published to IPFS. The IPFS hash is then written to MIX Blockchain, producing a permanent itemId.</p><p id="0fd7" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This is a much more sophisticated system than LBRY which does not transcode videos.

This creates a problem. When users migrate from device to device they are accustomed to their private settings following them. On Acuity, your Trust network is public so that follows you from device to device, but other settings do not. Which feeds you are subscribed to is a private setting and is currently set per-device.</p><p id="4cd1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">It would be very easy to set up a centralized database for this sort of thing, but this would undermine the whole point of a decentralized autonomous platform.</p><p id="3d0c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no pb nq nr ns pc nu nv nw pd ny nz oa pe oc od oe pf og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">A better way is to encrypt user settings and enable other users in your Trust Network to store and give you back your settings.</p><h2 id="002d" class="ok mo fr be mp ol om on mt oo op oq mx nw or os ot oa ou ov ow oe ox oy oz pa bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Clear UI distinction between on-chain and off-chain actions</h2><p id="714f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph nl nm fr nn b no np nq nr ns nt nu nv nw nx ny nz oa ob oc od oe of og oh oi fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Some actions in Acuity are performed by broadcasting transactions to the blockchain while others simply update the local database.
