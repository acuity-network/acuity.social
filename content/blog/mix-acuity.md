It is a desktop browser for MIX Blockchain. Its initial functionality is broadly similar to Twitter / Reddit, except it is fully decentralized.</p><p id="f013" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gg mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The system is fully autonomous and there is no backend. No-one can prevent you from interacting with the system.</p><p id="9e5c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gg mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Acuity can be installed on Mac, Windows and Linux. Download from here: <a class="af nl" href="https://github.com/mix-blockchain/mix-acuity/releases" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">https://github.com/mix-blockchain/mix-acuity/releases</a> For Mac you’ll probably want to grab the .dmg file, for windows a .exe file and for Linux the .AppImage file. MIX Acuity is not yet signed by Apple so you will get a warning about that. Acuity includes ethminer for mining MIX, so it is possible that anti-virus software will flag that.</p><p id="29cf" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gg mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">In order to get started, you will need some MIX and someone to add to your trust network. Both of these things can be found by joining the <a class="af nl" href="https://discord.gg/DRz3jne" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">MIX Discord channel</a>. People there will be able to help you with any issues you may encounter.</p><p id="ea23" class="pw-post-body-paragraph mn mo gg mp b mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">MIX Acuity is still very experimental so you will probably find a few bugs and rough edges.
