It has a <a class="af mx" href="https://blocks.mix-blockchain.org" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">block explorer</a> and <a class="af mx" href="https://stats.mix-blockchain.org/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">network stats</a>.</p><p id="460c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The linked data is encoded with <a class="af mx" href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Protocol Buffers</a>. It has an upgradable schema system which means that LINK’s content types are inheritable.</p><p id="cf2f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">For example, a standard story type could be extended by a publication with information specific to its proprietary app. Regular apps would still be able to display the story.</p><p id="a33e" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Other potential content types are user profiles, Reddit posts, tweets, badges, media metadata and business metadata.</p><p id="69c1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">The encoded data is compressed with <a class="af mx" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brotli" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">Google Brotli</a> and stored in <a class="af mx" href="http://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/contracts.html#events" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">transaction logs</a> using the <a class="af mx" href="http://docs.link-blockchain.org/projects/blobstore/en/latest/" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">BlobStore</a> smart contract which I have developed.</p><p id="0c73" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Because LINK is an Ethereum blockchain it has the full power of Ethereum’s smart contract system. This allows for many useful smart contracts to be developed that can reference the content. For example, a key smart contract would be a feed contract that allows users to maintain a feed of content like RSS / Twitter / YouTube. Other important smart contracts would provide functionality such as content voting, tagging, badge awarding, etc.</p><p id="83b1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">A key feature of LINK is that it is uncontrolled. At a base level no one can be prevented from publishing. Certain filter bubbles will become popular and some users may not like the way they operate. However, this creates the incentive for more filter bubbles to be created. Because LINK is programmable at every level a new filter bubble can be created that is based on the same content as the other filter bubbles. This is in stark contrast to existing services such as Twitter, Medium, Reddit or YouTube where the content can only be accessed via the filter bubble provided by each siloed service.</p><p id="cb2d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">An advantage to storing small pieces of content as “transaction attachments” using BlobStore instead of IPFS or Swarm is that there is incentivization for old content to be stored even after the creator is no longer prepared to pay for it. It would be really annoying if old content on Twitter or Reddit simply disappeared. Node operators are incentivized to store and serve old content because they will get paid by light clients. Potentially, old or rare content could have a higher price tag. Because publishers have to pay a fee that is in proportion to the size of the data, node operators cannot be spammed with content to store.</p><p id="3f8c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">LINK apps using Ethereum’s light client functionality will be able to very efficiently query full nodes for multiple content items in a single round-trip.</p><p id="a4c8" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Once the size of the content database increases, nodes may wish to reduce the amount of content they are storing. They can trim their transaction logs based on age, language, popularity, or content type, for example.</p><p id="6b92" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Larger items such as images or video are not well suited to storing in transaction logs. LINK will have media metadata content types that contain identifiers to the actual media in various fidelities and delivery systems.</p><h1 id="8552" class="my mz fr be na nb nc nd ne nf ng nh ni nj nk nl nm nn no np nq nr ns nt nu nv bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">Issuance</h1><p id="2435" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc nw me mf mg nx mi mj mk ny mm mn mo nz mq mr ms oa mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">LINK has a built-in <a class="af mx" href="http://docs.link-blockchain.org/en/latest/issuance.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">2000 day bootstrap</a> mechanism to fund the project. 5 years worth of mining is pre-allocated into a smart contract that will gradually release it to myself over the 2000 days at an ever slowing rate. This revenue will be sold as necessary to fund the project and (ultimately) to provide profit for myself. Thus I am financially incentivized to invest the LINK that is released in a way that will increase the value of LINK.</p><p id="97e6" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">This “continuous crowdfund” is quite different to a lot of Ethereum startups that are seeking a large amount of capital upfront.</p><figure class="ob oc od oe of og"><div class="oh ib l ee"><div class="oi oj l"><iframe src="https://cdn.embedly.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fembed.chartblocks.com%2F1.0%2F%3Fc%3D583556329973d2de6f22b179%26t%3D9c8a2ec16e7f9ea&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fpublic.chartblocks.com%2Fc%2F583556329973d2de6f22b179%3Ft%3D9c8a2ec16e7f9ea&amp;image=http%3A%2F%2Fd3ugvbs94d921r.cloudfront.net%2F583556329973d2de6f22b179.png&amp;key=d04bfffea46d4aeda930ec88cc64b87c&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=chartblocks" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="280" width="690" title="Link issuance" class="eo n ff dy bg" scrolling="no"></iframe></div></div></figure></div></div></div><div class="ab ca ok ol om on" role="separator"><span class="oo bx bl op oq or"></span><span class="oo bx bl op oq or"></span><span class="oo bx bl op oq"></span></div><div class="fk fl fm fn fo"><div class="ab ca"><div class="ch bg ew ex ey ez"><p id="d2cb" class="pw-post-body-paragraph lz ma fr mb b mc md me mf mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw fk bj" data-selectable-paragraph="">I am very interested to have feedback from the community.
