<p>Update: BlobStore is now called <a href="https://docs.mix-blockchain.org/en/latest/item_store.html" target="_blank">Item Store</a>.</p>

<p>BlobStore is an Ethereum smart contract I have been developing on and off for about a year. In January I wrote a blog post about the <a href="/blog/ethereum-text-publishing/">properties of various decentralized storage technologies</a>. BlobStore specifically targets <a href="https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/develop/contracts.html#events" target="_blank">Ethereum log storage</a>. The premise is simple — store a blob (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_storage" target="_blank">Binary Large OBject</a>) and get an identifier for it - blobId). For the rest of time that blob can be retrieved using that blobId.</p>

<p>The contract has evolved quite substantially since I first wrote it to add more features such as ownership, configurability, rudimentary revisioning, contract upgradability, testing, and reduced gas costs.</p>

<p>Example use-cases for BlobStore are blog posts, tweets, Reddit posts, user profiles, media metadata, smart contract source code.</p>

<p>Version 1.0 has now been released. It has been deployed on Ethereum. I will also deploy it to Ethereum Classic and Expanse. It will be the primary contract on the soon-to-be-launched MIX Blockchain.</p>
